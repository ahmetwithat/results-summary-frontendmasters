## Overview

My first FrontendMentor challenge and my first time actually styling something by looking at the design. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I don't really know what I am supposed to say here. It was a pretty straight-forward challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow -- not really but the media query is for the desktop so i guess?

## Acknowledgments

Kevin Powell is great. Awesome guy. (You can tell I did this without looking at his code by the way the code is poorly written)
